# Mobula-tag-maps
Purpose

This code is for mapping the release and popoff locations for mobulas tagged with Wildlife computers popoff survival archival (sPAT) tags.
Tags are mapped together for all events and for subsets by species or tag. 

Problems

I still need to work on map elements of scale bar and north arrow. Not sure why getting errors.
